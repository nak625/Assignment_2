## Overview
This Python project consists of an HTML file 'index.html'. This 

### 1. `index.html`
- Upon page load, the US Population data is retrieved from an API endpoint. Then the data is parsed, sorted, and properly displayed in a table.
- The file contains inline css styling and uses the T/t2 html tags instead of a card or header. So both the title and the data are in the table.

### 2. Usage
- if all files are downloaded you should just be able to open index.html and have the results displayed on page load.
